# Trash-Pandas-nest
Hey y'all! Welcome to Trash Pandas' Nest. This is a repository for Trash pandasâ€™ evil plan...

The project provides an overview of popular companies in stock market, the exposure of them in news and their searching popularity on the Internet. We hope this project could lower the learning barrier of stocks, provide people with helpful financial insights, and encourage people to learn more about how to invest in stocks in a scientific way, as people with such interests are our targeted audience.

We aim to explore the following questions with the models we build and the analysis we make -
* Is Media Exposure connected to stock price?
* What is the connection between them? Should you invest in hot-topic?
* What are some specific examples to illustrate this concept (irrational market)?
* What is a good strategy of avoiding financial crisis in investment?

The dataset of stock price, news mention and search hit ranges from Nov 2013 to Nov 2018. It covers the popular companies including Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Tesla and Bitcoin in the form of stocks. While we obtaining our stock data from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/), our news mention data is coming from the APIs provided by two of the largest presses in the world - [The Guardian](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/) from the UK and [The NY Times](https://developer.nytimes.com/) from the US. We also have our search hits data from [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US) provided by Google.
